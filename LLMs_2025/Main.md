# Year-Long Roadmap for NLP/LLMs  
A structured guide to mastering Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), from beginner to advanced.  

## 📌 Phase 1: Foundations (Months 1-3)  
**Goal:** Understand the basics of NLP, embeddings, transformers, and language modeling.  
- Learn Python and essential ML libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow.  
- Study NLP fundamentals: tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging, NER, syntactic parsing.  
- Get comfortable with pre-trained models (spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face).  
- Start with classic NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.  
- Suggested Courses:  
  - [Deep Learning for NLP (Stanford CS224N)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)  
  - [Fast.ai NLP Course](https://course.fast.ai/)  
  - [Hugging Face’s NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/)  

## 🚀 Phase 2: Intermediate (Months 4-6)  
**Goal:** Understand transformer architectures, pre-training, and fine-tuning.  
- Study BERT, GPT, and T5 architectures.  
- Work with Hugging Face's Transformers library.  
- Fine-tune pre-trained models on custom datasets.  
- Learn about transfer learning, self-supervised learning, and evaluation metrics.  
- Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER), Machine Translation, and Question Answering.  
- Suggested Projects:  
  - Build a chatbot using transformers.  
  - Implement a text summarization model.  
  - Experiment with zero-shot and few-shot learning.  

## 🔥 Phase 3: Advanced LLMs (Months 7-9)  
**Goal:** Dive deeper into LLMs, training paradigms, and advanced applications.  
- Learn about Foundation Models, prompting strategies, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
- Study model alignment, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).  
- Work on LLM fine-tuning using LoRA, PEFT, and quantization techniques.  
- Explore multi-modal learning and multimodal LLMs.  
- Suggested Projects:  
  - Implement a RAG pipeline.  
  - Build a domain-specific LLM application.  
  - Work on fine-tuning a foundation model for a real-world use case.  

## 🎓 Phase 4: Research & Cutting-Edge (Months 10-12)  
**Goal:** Contribute to research and stay updated with emerging trends.  
- Study agentic LLMs, model interpretability, and ethical considerations.  
- Learn about efficient LLM training, model compression, and distributed training.  
- Explore recent papers from NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL, and EMNLP.  
- Suggested University Courses:  
  1. [CMU Advanced NLP](https://lnkd.in/gaG2EVsH)  
  2. [CS886 Waterloo on Foundation Models](https://lnkd.in/gGzzeYPB)  
  3. [CS294/194-196 Large Language Model Agents](https://lnkd.in/g2JPxcga)  
- Suggested Research Topics:  
  - Graph RAG and Hybrid RAG architectures.  
  - Efficient training techniques for LLMs.  
  - Interpretability and fairness in LLMs.  

## 🏆 Final Milestone  
By the end of this roadmap, you should be able to:  
✅ Train and fine-tune LLMs on custom datasets.  
✅ Deploy LLM applications efficiently.  
✅ Contribute to open-source projects and research.  
✅ Stay updated with cutting-edge advancements in the field.  

Happy Learning! 🚀
